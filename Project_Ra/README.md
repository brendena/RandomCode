#project Ra
## first
```bash
git clone https://github.com/brendena/Project_Ra
git branch yourName 
### this will be your personal branch of your code
### so you can code without conflicts
git checkout yourName
### the will move you into yourName branch.
### "git branch yourName " just creates the branch
### the checkout function move you to the branch
```
So after this your ready to go and create your 
own code.



## Ready to commit
```bash
git add --all
### will add all the file and all the changes 
### that you've made
git commit -m "your message"
### this will commit these changes localy
git push origin yourName
### this will push your code up to github
### and into your branch of the code.
``` 


## merging
if we have some code that will be universally
once we meet up on Wensday or Friday we can
go over the code and commit it.

Else if where all working on the same piece of 
code and we need to merge a lot sooner because
you have a piece of code that everbody else needs.
Then do a 
```bash
git push origin master
```
And probably at the end of the day i'll go through 
and make sure it merges properly.
