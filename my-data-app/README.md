# potential problems solved

### github page 
I have a script called pushGHP.sh
just run it and will push the latest changes
for how i configured it go [here](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/tools/reusable-elements)


### credentials google
google doesn't have credentials that either mean you didn't whitelist the url and if so go [here](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/)

Or you might be testing on 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost


### problem with loading some pages.

There was this weird bug where i had to go through all the files and remove the polymer component from all but the head element.
