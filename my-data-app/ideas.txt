TODO
can't seem to get the redraw to work right

default page  kind of
make sure it waights untill gamps is finished loading
you can only go to a certain list of places else 404 error




so i'm thinking about edit most of this code.
To make it into a class like object.
so like

{
	//attributes-
	typeOfDate
	//maby
	startDate
	googleChartObject

	endDate
	//each promise will be its own fuction
	//i think that would be the best way of doing this.
}


Also i'm think i should have a perfecial way of
handling comments.  So i don't have to just
keep uncommenting stuff evertime.

Also maby some tdd would be cool.

also probably some error handling would be cool

Some documentation would also be really cool


maby use google anaylitcs to show data
