#first step is to get the basic actions working. 
#  1. start game
#  2. restart game
#  3. have random actions
#  4. get the score value

#second need to store the data

#third  create nural network

------Try and do a basic cnn without a q style of learning

1. I need to know how to manage the input
    -- see how this guy used pong for input neural net 
    -- https://medium.com/@dhruvp/how-to-write-a-neural-network-to-play-pong-from-scratch-956b57d4f6e0
2. then i have to build the neural network.

3. Then i can run a bunch of trials and save them to a file

4. Then i can test the neural network

5. Then repeat last steps untill its really good.


---  Then try q learning
